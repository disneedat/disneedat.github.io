        <p>it's a good day for a beginning. almighty always with me. Hydrogen was inspired by Bret Victor's ideas about the power of instantaneous feedback and the design of Light Table. Running code inline and in real time is a more natural way to develop. By bringing the interactive style of Light Table to the rock-solid usability of Atom, Hydrogen makes it easy to write code the way you want to.

        watch expressions let you keep track of variables and re-run snippets after every change
        completions from the running kernel, just like autocomplete in the Chrome dev tools
        code can be inspected to show useful information provided by the running kernel
        one kernel per language (so you can run snippets from several files, all in the same namespace)
        interrupt or restart the kernel if anything goes wrong
        use a custom kernel connection (for example to run code inside Docker), read more in the "Custom kernel connection (inside Docker)" section
